# 📊 Insurance Data Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes insurance policy data, customer demographics, claim behaviour, and overall portfolio performance using Power BI.  
The dashboard provides an interactive view of premium collections, claim outcomes, age-based risk patterns, and policy activity levels.

The report helps identify which segments contribute the most to claims, which policy types generate the highest revenue, and how customers behave across different demographics.
